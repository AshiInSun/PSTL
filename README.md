# PSTL
Projet STL - Experimentation between Alias algorithm implemented by unuran and a new one.

In the repositery, you will find "dau" file. These are the files from the unuran library that implements the Alias Algorithm. Note that it is highly recommended to download the all library, because these files uses methods and structures implemented in the unuran library. You can find the source files of the library here : 
https://github.com/scipy/unuran.git 
BUT I highly recommend to download the source files here : https://statmath.wu.ac.at/software/unuran/download.html 
"Step 2, Download UNURAN (version 1.11.0)" because you'll find some configuration files that are missing in the github.
The file which implements the alias algorithm can be find in the directory src/methods.

You also can find the documentation of unuran here : https://statmath.wu.ac.at/software/unuran/ 
and the documentation of the Alias Algorithm here : https://statmath.wu.ac.at/software/unuran/doc/unuran.html#DAU in the section "5.8.2 DAU – (Discrete) Alias-Urn method".
